> Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

This adapter is a wrapper around the [`auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/auth) library from Web3Auth (previously Torus) and enables the main social login features of Web3Auth. By default, Web3Auth has
certain configuration set to enable a quick integration, however, for customising features, like Whitelabel,
Custom Authentication, etc. you need to customise the Auth Adapter. With the Auth Adapter package installed and
instantiated, you can explore a number of options and can customise the login experience of the user as per your needs.
