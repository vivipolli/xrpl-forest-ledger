# ForestLedger - Environmental Reserve Certification Platform 🌿

A blockchain-based platform that enables landowners to tokenize their environmental reserves as NFTs, providing transparent and verifiable proof of environmental preservation.

## 🌍 Overview

ForestLedger transforms environmental preservation efforts into digital certificates using NFT technology on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The platform integrates satellite imagery and environmental data to create unique digital certificates that represent verified environmental reserves, with an approval process to ensure data integrity.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Satellite Integration**: Automatic fetching of satellite imagery based on geographical coordinates
- **Environmental Data Verification**: Collection and verification of key environmental metrics:
  - Vegetation coverage
  - Water bodies count
  - Springs count
  - Hectares calculation
  - Ongoing preservation projects
  - CAR Registry (Rural Environmental Registry)
- **Approval Process**: Two-step verification system:
  - Initial request submission with environmental data
  - Admin review and approval before minting
- **NFT Generation**: Creation of unique digital certificates with:
  - Satellite imagery
  - Environmental metrics
  - Verification timestamps
  - Unique identifiers
- **Blockchain Integration**: Secure minting and storage on XRP Ledger
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with Xumm wallet

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: XRP Ledger (XRPL)
- **Wallet**: Xumm Wallet integration
- **Maps**: Satellite imagery API integration
- **Storage**: IPFS for NFT metadata

## 💡 Usage

1. Connect your Xumm wallet
2. Input environmental reserve coordinates
3. Fill in the environmental metrics form
4. Submit for verification
5. Wait for admin approval
6. Receive your environmental NFT certificate

## 🔒 Security

- All transactions are secured through XRP Ledger blockchain
- Environmental data is verified through satellite imagery and admin review
- NFT metadata is stored on IPFS for permanence
- Smart contract ensures immutable record keeping
